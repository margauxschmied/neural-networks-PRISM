Implementation of an LI&F type biological neuron with the help of the probabilistic model checker PRISM.

Then realization of 3 mini-circuits proposed in figure 1 of the article "On the Use of Formal Methods to Model and Verify Neuronal Archetypes", the simple series, the parallel composition and the contralateral inhibition.

And finally addition of tests of properties of temporal logic concerning these mini-circuits.
